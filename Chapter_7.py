=== 7.1: Exercises with classes ===
Use the python documentation on classes at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html 
to solve the following exercises.
1. Implement a class named "Rectangle" to store the coordinates of a rectangle given
by (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
2. Implement the class constructor with the parameters (x1, y1, x2, y2) and store
them in the class instances using the "self" keyword.
3. Implement the "width()" and "height()" methods which return, respectively, the
width and height of a rectangle. Create two objects, instances of "Rectangle" to
test the calculations.
4. Implement the method "area" to return the area of the rectangle (width*height).
5. Implement the method "circumference" to return the perimeter of the rectangle
(2*width + 2*height).
6. Do a print of one of the objects created to test the class. Implement the "__str__"
method such that when you print one of the objects it print the coordinates as (x1,
y1)(x2, y2).""")

=== 7.3: Exercises with inheritance ===
Use the "Rectangle" class as implemented above for the following exercises:
1. Create a "Square" class as subclass of "Rectangle".
2. Implement the "Square" constructor. The constructor should have only the x1, y1
coordinates and the size of the square. Notice which arguments youâ€™ll have to use
when you invoce the "Rectangle" constructor when you use "super".
3. Instantiate two objects of "Square", invoke the area method and print the objects.
Make sure that all calculations are returning correct numbers and that the coordinates of
the squares are consistent with the size of the square used as argument.""")
