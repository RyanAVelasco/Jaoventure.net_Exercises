=== 6.1 Exercises with dictionaries ===
Use the python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes. 
html#mapping-types-dict to solve the following exercises.
Take the following python dictionary:
ages = {
    "Peter": 10,
    "Isabel": 11,
    "Anna": 9,
    "Thomas": 10,
    "Bob": 10,
    "Joseph": 11,
    "Maria": 12,
    "Gabriel": 10,
}

1. How many students are in the dictionary? Search for the "len" function.
2. Implement a function that receives the "ages" dictionary as parameter and return
the average age of the students. Traverse all items on the dictionary using the
"items" method as above.
3. Implement a function that receives the "ages" dictionary as parameter and returns
the name of the oldest student.
4. Implement a function that receives the "ages" dictionary and a number "n" and
returns a new dict where each student is n years older. 
For instance, new_ages(ages, 10) returns a copy of "ages" where each student is 10 years older.""")

The question wasn't clear enough so I assume that '..each student is 10 years older.' means a new
dictionary containing all students above n age.""")

=== 6.2: Exercises with sub-dictionaries ===
Take the following dictionary:

    "Isabel": {"age": 11, "address": "Sesimbra"},
    "Anna": {"age": 9, "address": "Lisbon"},
}

1. How many students are in the "students" dict? Use the appropriate function.
2. Implement a function that receives the students dict and returns the average age.
3. Implement a function that receives the students dict and an address, and returns
a list with the name of all students which address matches the address in the
argument. 
For instance, invoking "find_students(students, â€™Lisbonâ€™)" should return
Peter and Anna.""")
