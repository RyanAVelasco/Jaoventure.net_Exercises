print("""\n\n4.1: Exercises with the math module
Use the python documentation about the math module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
to solve the following exercises:
1. Find the greatest common divisor of the following pairs of numbers: (15, 21), (152,200), (1988, 9765).
2. Compute the base-2 logarithm of the following numbers: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 15.
3. Use the "input" function to ask the user for a number and show the result of the sine, cosine and tangent
of the number. 
Make sure that you convert the user input
from string to a number (use the int() or the float() function).""")

1. Implement the "add2" function that receives two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the numbers. 
Then implement the "add3" function that receives and sums 3 parameters.
2. Implement a function that returns the greatest of two numbers given as parameters.
Use the "if" statement to compare both numbers: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements.
3. Implement a function named "is_divisable" that receives two parameters (named"a" and "b") 
and returns true if "a" can be divided by "b" or false otherwise. 
A number is divisable by another when the remainder of the division is zero. 
Use the modulo operator ("%").
4. Create a function named "average" that computes the average value of a list passed as parameter to the function. 
Use the "sum" and "len" functions.""")

1. Implement the factorial function and test it with several different values. 
Cross-check with a calculator.
2. Implement a recursive function to compute the sum of then first integer numbers(wheren is a function parameter). 
Start by thinking about the base case (the sum of the first 0 integers is?) and then think about the recursive case.
3. The Fibonnaci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number of the sequence matches 
the sum of the previous two terms. 
Given the following recursive definition implement fib(n).
#  See PDF for fib(n) image
Check your results for the first numbers of the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,34, 55, 89, ...""")
